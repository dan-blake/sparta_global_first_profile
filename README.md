Creating a Responsive Mobile first design Profile

Starting from an unresponsive CSS layout of Steve's profile (or your own version if you prefer) use CSS media queries to make the website aesthetically pleasing at all screen widths and devices. Ensure the page has at least two noticeably different layouts at different screen widths.

Information to be taken into account:
Remember that CSS is read downwards and overwrites as it goes down
Start mobile first - how does this dictate what kind of media query you will use?
The panels on the projects page are perfect for making responsive - how could you position them to make better use of the space you have?
Have a look at common websites and how they handle responsiveness - how complex is a usual mobile page compared to a full width desktop page?

Summary of the brief:
--> Create a profile page that is tailored towards at least two different screen widths.
--> Apply design principles in order to create a free flowing page with no overlaps.
--> Start with a mobile first design approach

Challenges experienced:
--> With a wide variety of CSS applied there were many issues when trying to apply these to a smaller screen size. In order to overcome this all previously
    specified margins and paddings were adjusted to % or auto values (could also be rem values)
--> I found that if I did not re specify float values the media query inherited from the full view of the page. After a lot of frustration this was overcome
   and in researching this I discovered a few other ways to create grids and structure a page design e.g. flex boxes.

What I would add next:
--> JavaScript classes and states in order to create a better UX.
--> More information will be added further into the Academy experience.
